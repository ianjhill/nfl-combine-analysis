NFL Scouting Combine Data Analysis

This project analyzes NFL Scouting Combine data from 2004 to 2023 to investigate the relationship between player performance metrics and draft outcomes. The study aims to answer three key questions:

How do combine event performances correlate with draft round?

Can positions be predicted based on combine performance, and which positions excel in specific events?

What is the relationship between players who were drafted and their combine performance?

Key Features

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values for draft round and combine performance metrics to ensure robustness.

Exploratory Analysis: Utilized visualizations (scatterplots, correlation matrices, histograms, and violin plots) to uncover trends and patterns.

Machine Learning Models: Applied algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and HistGradientBoost Classifier to predict draft status and player positions.

Statistical Validation: Conducted tests to ensure findings were not due to chance.

Dataset

The dataset contains over 3,000 observations, with each row representing a player’s draft round, position, and performance in events like the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, bench press, and more.

Insights

The findings provide actionable insights into how combine performance metrics influence draft outcomes and player roles, offering potential improvements for NFL teams’ scouting and draft strategies.
